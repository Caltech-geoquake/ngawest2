# ==================
# BBP application 
# ==================

A module that implement pynga in BBP (specific platform) to compute 
median and standard deivation of ground motions 

Class to generalize the input file formats (for future applications) 

and read simulation results, simulation parameters (src, site location, site condition 
and other needed information for comparison and validation)
