# ==================
# BBP application 
# ==================
A module that implement pynga in BBP (specific platform) to compute 
median and standard deivation of ground motions 

./GMPEworkflow.py shows the general workflow when applying pynga in BBP 

./GenerateStationList.py is an utility that generates stations list based on src input for designing 
simulations for comparison. 

first input argument: distance to extend the fault trace end
second: grid size for generating stations locations 
third: number of stations to select ( the condition such as Rrup = 30 or 50 can be manually set in the code)
forth: plot or not (1 or 0)
