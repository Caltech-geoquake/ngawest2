PYTHON PACKAGE: pynga
AUTHOR: Feng Wang, Jan, 2012

DESCRIPTION 
    The Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) 2008 Ground Motion Prediction Equations

COMPONENTS
    0. combination of all NGA models 
       __init__.py 
    1. 4 NGA models 
       AS08.py, BA08.py, CB08.py, CY08.py 
    
    2. Spudich and Chiou 2008 directivity model (under-construction)
       SC08.py 
    
    3. NGA dataset (xls format) manipulation
       NGAdataset.py 
    
    4. NGA dataset 
       ./NGAdata/NGA_Flatfile.xls 
    
    5. Verification with OpenSHA, Matlab, and R version of NGA models (median and standard deviation)
       ./Verification
  
    6. Utilities to compute input parameters needed for NGA models and FlingStudy
       ./FlingStudy

DOWNLOAD 
    Since the package is version-controlled on GitHub, so you can clone the package using "git clone" 
	git clone git@github.com:fengw/pynga.git 


INSTALLATION
    1. Pre-Install:
	Python with numpy, pyproj, xlrd, xlwt installed
	or install EPD (which contains almost every module you need)

    2. ADD to PYTHONPATH (on MacOS and Linux)
        Assuming you download the package in local computer at ${HOME}/local/pynga

	vi ./.bashrc (assuming you use bash)
	   first, set up your PYTHONHOME (where you installed your python)
	   second, set up the PYTHONPATH, usually, it equals to 
	       export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONHOME}/lib/python{version}/site_packages
	   third, add the package downloaded into the PYTHONPATH by 
	      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/local/pynga:$PYTHONPATH

USAGE
   Open python or ipython, type: import pynga

For the verification of pynga, go to ./Verification, and see README for further information 
For one application of pynga, go to ./FlingStudy, and see README for further information
