In ./plots 

For each NGA model, the validation is performed. 
for example, ./plots/BA08/ 

1. RMS
   for each file set computed by original modelers (V1) and pynga (V2) 
   Y-axis: err = sqrt( 1/N * sum( ((V1-V2)/V1)**2 ) ) where N is the total number of data points to validate. 
   and what are show is err * 100 (%) and the black dash lines are +- 0.02% for reference, and x-axis: Period 
   green dot: PGA
   blue dot: PGV
   red dot: SA at various periods

2. Scatter 
   for each file set computed by original modelers (V1) and pynga (V2) 
   Y-axis: err = V2-V1 (for each period) 
   X-axis: Rjb  
   each subplot corresponds to each periods (-1: PGA, -2: PGV)
