Application of pynga to FlingStudy

DESCRIPTION
    The Fling study is a set of broadband platform simulations defined by NGA researchers and 
    run by the SCEC Broadband platform group as part of a California seismic hazard evaluation project.
    What pynga can do is to compute ground motion levels using NGA models and compare them with 
    results from broadband simulations.

COMPONENTS
    ./inputs   # informations used in broadband simulations, such as source info and site info 
    ./FlingNGA.py     # main function to perform the computation of ground motion intensity and visualization 
    ./FlingUtils.py   # local utilities used by FlingNGA.py for plots and other
USAGE
    ./FlingNGA.py {SourceID} {RuptureID} {Option}
    
    Where SourceID should be same as what in ./inputs/Scenario* (140,141,142)
          RuptureID can be found in ./inputs/Scenario*/SrcDesc1/v* (00,01,02, etc.)
          Option could be: ComputeDist, PlotDist, ComputePSA, PlotPSA
          when plotPSA, use 
          ./FlingNGA.py 142 00 PlotPSA 3.0 
          where 3.0 is the period at which you want to plot PSA 

Note: you can also compute PGA,PGV (just slight modification in ComputePSA section of FlingNGA.py) 
      ./outputs and ./plots will be created when you use FlingNGA.py
